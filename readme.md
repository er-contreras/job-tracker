# Job tracker
- This is an executable app to add job applications

## Add executable to your $PATH
- export PATH=$PATH:path/to/job-tracker/bin

## Run the job tracker on terminal
- Onw way to run the executable is by going to the `job-tracker` directory and run `open bin/job-tracker` from there.
- The other way is by just typing `bin/job-tracker` on the terminal, doesn't matter where you are located.

* I recommend the first option 'cause it opens by default the native terminal on your OS.
