# This is an idea for improve my coding skills as well as my reflexions through coding.
# How can I make an abstraction of what I'm thinking in code?
# I mean for example, normally I write by hand on my note book the thoughts that I feel has something important to say about me.
# What if instead of make that I could make the exercise of coding it.

# For example:
# I have to have in mind all my expenses of the month and output the total at the end.
# How would I write a script to keep track of that every month?
